# SSH Port Monitoring and Threat Response 🛡️

This project is a real-time monitoring solution designed to detect brute-force SSH attacks and respond to potential intrusion attempts using system logs and analytics. Built as part of a cybersecurity internship program, it demonstrates log analysis, threat detection, and alerting principles.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time monitoring of SSH activity via `auth.log`
- 📊 Detection of brute-force attacks using failed login patterns
- 📁 Log parsing and file handling with Python
- 🧠 Customizable thresholds for suspicious activity
- ⚠️ Alerting system for multiple failed attempts from the same IP
- 📈 Data prepared for visualization (e.g., Splunk, ELK, Grafana)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Linux** (Tested on Kali Linux and Ubuntu)
- **Systemd log files** (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- **Bash scripting**
- *(Optional: Splunk, ELK Stack for visualization)*
